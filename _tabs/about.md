Hi! My name is **Juan Carlos Lopez** and I work at *Plain Concepts* as a **Software Engineer**. 👨‍💻

I love everything related to technology, which makes me passionate about my work. ❤️

In this blog I try to write about real problems that I face in my day to day and how I solve them (together with my teammates). 🔨⚙️

If you have any questions or doubts do not hesitate to contact me. 😄
